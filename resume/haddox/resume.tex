    {\texttt{>}brainfuse}
    {Programming Language}
    {\emph{Compiler, interpreter, \& language extension of brainf**k}\\Programmed primarily in C, this project grew organically out of an initial interpreter and compiler built out of curiosity. While still in progress, preprocessing directives, functions, and language concept extensions are planned. Preprocessing directives such as file inclusion are complete, and more complex preprocessing involving a psuedo-instruction language will be finished soon. These psuedo-instructions will enable brainfuse programmers to easily generate code to set the datapointer to some value, or print out a string. Various script utilities have also been developed to simplify compiling and running brainfuse code.\\Tools utilized: \emph{C, Bash}}
  \entry
    {Nov--Dec 2016}
    {Doorway}
    {VR Art Installation}
    {\emph{Art with Portals}\\Developed using the Unity game engine and Steam's Vive SDK, this project implements portal visualization through the use of shaders and matrix transformations. It attempts to evoke emotion of a stark and mysterious landscape. The user starts in a small room, with a \lq portal\rq\ device in front of them, which leads to a bleak, tree-dotted landscape. The user can move back and forth through the portal at will.\\Tools utilized: \emph{Unity, C\#, HLSL, Unity Shader Language, Vive SDK}}
